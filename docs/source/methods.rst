Graph Construction Methods
==============================

This package supports multiple methods to compute brain connectivity matrices from BOLD time-series signals. The resulting matrices are converted into graph structures.

.. note::

   - Some methods (e.g., ``lingam``, ``generalised_synchronisation_matrix``) are computationally expensive and slow for large inputs.
   - All methods return a square connectivity matrix which is post-processed into a graph using edge index + edge weight.
   - You can save graphs in `.pt` (PyTorch Geometric) or `.csv` formats.
